## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

My major learnings while working through this project are making Mobile-first workflow ,the way to use static fonts using css and a bit about media quries .etc.


```html

  
  <link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
@font-face {
    font-family: myFont;
    src: url( outfitFonts/static/Outfit-Regular.ttf);
}

}
```

### Continued development

The  topics that I want to continue focusing on in future projects are flexbox and media qureies . I am not completely comfortable with these topics and I want to learn some new useful techniques that 'll help me to create a refine and perfect project.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://w3schools.com) - This helped me a lot while working through this project, through a lot of helpful examples. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
